Homework 2 - Spooler

Compilation
********************************************************************************
To compile, run make. This produces an executable called "spooler". The commands
addqueue, showqueue, and rmqueue are implemented as subcommands (since I didn't
know that we had to implement these things as separate commands). However, I've
set up shell scripts called addqueue, showqueue, and rmqueue. These shell
scripts invoke spooler with the appropriate command line args.

Installation
********************************************************************************
To install the appropriate commands to /usr/bin, run make install. Make install
actually does the following configurations:

	- Creates a user called "spooler", deleting any old user if necessary.
	- Creates a directory called /var/spool/printer, overwriting any
	  directory if it exists. This newly created directory will be the
	  spool directory, so its permissions are set to 700.
	- Transfers ownership of /var/spool/printer to "spooler".
	- Changes permissions on addqueue, rmqueue, showqueue and spooler to
	  755.
	- Transfers ownership of the spooler executable to "spooler". This is
	  necessary for the next part (setting the suid bit).
	- Sets the suid bit on the spooler executable, so that any user who
	  runs this executable will run with the privileges of "spooler".
	- Copies addqueue, showqueue, rmqueue, and spooler to /usr/bin.

Usage
********************************************************************************
The spooler implements addqueue, rmqueue, and showqueue as subcommands.

addqueue:

	./spooler addqueue [files]

Files is a list of files to be added to the queue. They may be relative or
absolute paths to the files. A path is considered absolute if and only if it
begins with a '/'.

rmqueue:

	./spooler rmqueue [ids]

Ids is a list of ids of files to be removed from the queue. The desired ids
can be found with the showqueue command.

showqueue:

	./spooler showqueue

This command simply displays the contents of the spool.

IDs
********************************************************************************
If files are never removed from the spool, ids are allocated as contiguous
integers. So, the first id is a 1, the second is a 2, etc.

However, when a file gets deleted from the queue, its id is added to a pool of
"free ids". When an id is assigned to a file, the pool of free ids is first
checked. If it's nonempty, a free id is taken from the pool. Otherwise, a new
id is created based on the number of files in the spool.

The reason ID delegation is done in this way is that it's fairly human
readable and 100% free of collisions.

Filenames
********************************************************************************
Obviously, choosing a file name for the file in the spool directory is a bit
of a delicate task. The original filename must not be preserved, or there will
be collisions between files.

For collision-free naming, I decided to append the file's id (prefixed with an
underscore) to the last component of the filepath supplied by the user.
Because I choose unique ids, this ensures that no collisions will occur. Note
that the underscore is very important. Suppose there were no underscore.
Consider the filename:

	foo11

It's not possible to tell whether foo11 was originally "foo1" (and has id 1),
or or originally "foo" (and has id 11). Using the underscore disambiguates
things:

	foo_11 foo1_1

The first file was originally called "foo", and has id 11. The second file was
originally called "foo1" and has id 1.
